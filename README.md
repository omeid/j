# j [![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-reference-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://godoc.org/github.com/omeid/j)
J is a JSON library for Go (golang) with a focus on consistency and extensibility.

The project's aim is to provide a set of small api-compatible libraries that provides a comprehensive experience for working with JSON document and streams, from syntax checking to schema validation and encoding.

### Why?


### Credits

- The scanner design is heavily influenced by Rob Pike's [Lexical Scanning in Go](https://talks.golang.org/2011/lex.slide) talk and borrows some implementation details from the Go's standard library text and json scanner implementations.
