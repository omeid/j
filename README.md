J is a JSON library for Go (golang) with a focus on consistency and extensibility.

The project's aim is to provide a set of small api-compatible libraries that provides a comprehensive experience for working with JSON document and streams, from syntax checking to schema validation and encoding.

Please note that the project is in it's infancy stage and being rapidly developed, so some APIs may change until a point where all the required components are worked out and in a stable state. This notice will be removed once the API is considered stable.

### Why?
:tumbleweed:


### Credits

- The scanner design is heavily influenced by Rob Pike's [Lexical Scanning in Go](https://talks.golang.org/2011/lex.slide) talk and borrows some implementation details from the Go's standard library text and json scanner implementations.
